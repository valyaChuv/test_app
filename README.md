# Incremental Car Ads Data Loader

This application is designed to perform incremental loading of car ads data. It fetches new and updated data from a source and updates the local database accordingly.

## Features

- Incremental data loading: The application only fetches and loads the data that has been added or updated since the last run.
- Efficient data processing: The application uses a streamlined approach to minimize resource usage and ensure fast processing times.
- Configurable data sources: The application can be configured to fetch data from multiple sources, allowing for flexibility and scalability.
- Logging and monitoring: The application provides detailed logging and monitoring capabilities to track the progress and identify any issues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) to store the car ads data

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-ads-loader.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd car-ads-loader
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and configure the following settings:

   ```
   # Database connection
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=car_ads
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password

   # Data source configuration
   DATA_SOURCE_URL=https://api.example.com/car-ads
   DATA_SOURCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

2. Customize the configuration settings according to your environment and data source requirements.

### Usage

```

The application will fetch the new and updated car ads data from the configured source, process it, and update the local database accordingly.

### Logging and Monitoring
